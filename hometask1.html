          <h2>Elon Musk: Twitter says parts of source code leaked online</h2>
          </div>

          <p>
            Parts of the source code which underpins multi-billionaire Elon Musk's social media platform have been leaked online, Twitter says.
           It says the code was posted on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned service where software developers share code.
           It has now been taken down after Twitter requested its removal.
           Separately, Mr Musk has reportedly signalled to Twitter workers that the firm is worth less than half the $44bn (£36bn) he paid for it last year.
           As well as asking GitHub to take down the code, Twitter submitted a court filing in California in an attempt to find the person responsible.

            Artificial intelligence (AI) could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs says.
           It could replace a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe but may also mean new jobs and a productivity boom.
          And it could eventually increase the total annual value of goods and services produced globally by 7%.
          Generative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is "a major advancement", the report says.

          <h2>Very dangerous situation at Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant,says IAEA chief</h2>
          </div>
          <div clas="date">
          <h3>March 28, 2023</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraine’s Russian-occupied 
            Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as “very dangerous” and very unstable.
            The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, 
            forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors.
